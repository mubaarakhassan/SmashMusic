# SmashMusic -> iOS Music Application

With SmashMusic, it’s easy to find the right music for every moment – on your phone, your tablet and more. This is simply done by adding songs to the app.

SmashMusic is a simple music player with all the regular features you are used to. This music player is created in Swift for exercising my knowledge in the stack of iOS. Below is a little description of the features.


|   | Features                                                          | Added
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| A | Implement a basic app that allows you to play music (play, pause and next / back).| 1 | 
| B | Implemented a tab with all user playlists | 1 |
| C | If a user clicks on a playlist, you are moving to a new UITableViewController with all its playlist numbers.| 1 |
| D | Each playlist view has different sections such as: date the song was added, artist, playing time.| 1 | 
| E | The user can add and remove individual music from his playlist (also create a new playlist). | 1 |
| F | The app scales well on both an iPad and iPhone (+).| 1 |
| G | Provided a smart and non-blocking handling of threading that prevents your music from playing while using the app (multi-threading). | 1 |
| H | Ensured the application of good OO principles (loose coupling, strong cohesion). | 1 |
| I | Made sure you can shuffle and repeat playlists. | 1 | 
| J | Provided a basis for listen history in UITableView. | 1 |         
| K | Made sure you can display music, artist and album art when the phone is locked. | 1 | 
| L | The user can place an image with a playlist. | 1 |
| M | Extra features (e.g. top 40 music lijst / lastfm playlists toevoegen). | 1 |



## iOS API and others

The iOS APIs that I will use are AVFoundation to play audio. I also use TableViews and Segues.
Optionally I can also use [LastFM API](https://www.last.fm/api) to retrieve and save data (think of album artworks, list of top 40 etc).

Furthermore, the framework [Marqueelabel](https://github.com/cbpowell/MarqueeLabel) and [LNPopupController](https://github.com/LeoNatan/LNPopupController/blob/master/README.md) is  used in this app. To install it go to the specific linked pages.
